# api.cyberb.space

> :warning: This project has been ✨ _deprecated_ ✨

This was a monorepo for any personal APIs I want to expose. It was a mono repo because I'm cheap and don't want to pay more than $5 a month to support these little side projects.

At one point it did the following:
1. bespoke social media cards for [cyberb.space](https://cyberb.space)
2. an endpoint that turns [Oku Collection RSS feeds](https://oku.club/blog/oku-has-rss-feeds) into nice, useable API responses

# api.cyberb.space

This is a monorepo for any personal APIs I want to expose. It is a mono repo because I'm cheap and don't want to pay more than $5 a month to support these little side projects.

So far it includes: 
1. bespoke social media cards for [cyberb.space](https://cyberb.space)
2. an endpoint that turns [Oku Collection RSS feeds](https://oku.club/blog/oku-has-rss-feeds) into nice, useable API responses
